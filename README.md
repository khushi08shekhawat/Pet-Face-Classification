# Pet Face Classification üêæ

This project demonstrates a deep learning approach to classify pet faces (e.g., dog or cat) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow. It showcases the use of data augmentation, image preprocessing, and performance optimization for binary image classification.
